# Typing Fiesta

## A new typing-driven game in development by the team

### Note: The game is currently playable on computers only, as it requires access to keyboard functionalities. However future updates will make it be playable and comfortable to play.

 Typing Fiesta is a typing game where words slowly move to the right side of the screen. You must type the word to make them disappear. You will lose the game after enough words hit the right side of the screen. We hope you will enjoy the end product!
